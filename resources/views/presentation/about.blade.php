                <b>Pdfglue</b> was born to address that need. It is based on uploading static pdf files to the server, attaching a meaningful label to each file and reusing the pages as needed regardless of how many changes a document may require.

                Now managers can supply only what information is necessary to address an issue. Pick specific pages out of a multi-page document to send via email or print to local printer and make a specific point.
